# 🧱 YouBuidl – The Builder-First Social Feed for Public Goods

> "Post what you’re building. Earn support. Build in public. Onchain."

Welcome to **[YouBuidl](https://youbuidl.social)** — a decentralized, builder-first social layer for the public goods ecosystem. Share prototypes, links, memes, live widgets, and get supported instantly with donations and BuidlPoints.  
Built by [**Givestation**](https://givestation.org), and **natively aligned with Optimism**, YouBuidl is your onchain builder feed — open, composable, and verifiable.

## 🌀 The Evolution: From Givestation to YouBuidl

### 🏁 Originally: Givestation

Givestation launched as a platform to **fund public goods**, creators, and builders using milestone-based donations. We introduced onchain project reputation and contributed to shifting attention towards **build-in-public** narratives.

### ✨ Transition to YouBuidl

As usage grew, we realized:
> "Builders need support **before** the project is polished."

YouBuidl emerged as a response — giving builders a space to share early ideas, demos, and experiments while earning **social and financial support** directly from the community.
